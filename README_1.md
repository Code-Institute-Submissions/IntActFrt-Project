## First Time Visitor Goals
### As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and easily find what I want as I'm in a hurry; I'm either maintaining my bike, out on a ride and something needs mending, or I'm planning my ride.
### I really tried to make a site that is easy for all to use, and a site that conforms to the norms. Any major deviations will lead to confussion, making the site harder to use.
## Returning Visitor Goals
### As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about maintenance activities and maybe some training in my area. 
### I want to find things fast, I'm in a hurry; I'm either maintaining my bike, out on a ride and something needs mending, or I'm planning my ride.
# Design
## Colour Scheme
### The two main colours used are turquoise for the background colour of the site and light green for the text
## Typography
### The font was a standard one defined by Bootsrap, I have no desire to complicate the site and use phonts that make the site harder to read and therefore less useable. A san serif font is easy to read and all I want is a simple uncluttered site that delivers what the users need, fast efficient use.
## Imagery
### Imagery is important. The images used where all taken from Google searchs and then adapted to my requirements.
## Home Page Wireframe - View
### Below you can see the desktop wireframe;

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
### First Time Visitor Goals
## As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

## Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.

### The user has the option to navigate using the menu bar ontop, or to view a maintenance tip, or to buy clothing.
### As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

### The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user allowing them to return to the index.html, and to know where there are as the page they are on is highlighted subtly.
### The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links on the page.
### At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told to send an email, a message will be displayed informing the use that they are important and we will get back to them.
## Returning Visitor Goals
### As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new places to ride and repair my bike.
### These are clearly shown on the map page.


## The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact" Page, this shows the relvent information and displays clearly the fact that they have successfully sent an email.
### Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.


# Frequent User Goals
## As a Frequent User, I decided that they would need access to repair sites and places to ride, these will be added and the site will grow as the users add their favourite places that they want to share with other people.

# Further Testing
## The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX, using the functions in Google and the Responsinator.
## Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
# Known Bugs 
## The payment and address information does not work, to get the payment system working and to add a database behind the page is something that will be developed later.

# Deployment
## GitHub Pages
### The project was deployed to GitHub Pages.

# Credits
## Code
### I did not use a full-screen hero image in this version of my project.

### Bootstrap4: i used the Bootstrap Library throughout the project mainly to make site responsive using the Bootstrap Grid System.
### Bootstrap has been invaluable in making a resposive and useable website.
