## First Time Visitor Goals
### As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation and how to find things I donâ€™t know I need.
### I really tried to make a site that is easy for all to use, and a site that conforms to the norms. Any major deviations will lead to confussion, making the site harder to use.
## Returning Visitor Goals
### As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about maintenance activities and maybe some training in my area. 
# Design
## Colour Scheme
### The two main colours used are turquoise for the background colour of the site and light green for the text
## Typography
### The font was a standard one defined by Bootsrap, I have no desire to complicate the site and use phonts that make the site harder to read and therefore less useable.
## Imagery
### Imagery is important. The images used where all taken from Google searchs and then adapted to my requirements.
## Home Page Wireframe - View
### Below you can see the desktop wireframe;

### Below you can see the contact page wire frame;

# Features
## Responsive on all device sizes
### After speaking to my mentor I use some software called Responsinator to check that the site was able to adapt to many different devices.

# Interactive elements

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
#### HTML5
#### CSS3
## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
### Bootstrap 4.4.1:
#### Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
## Font Awesome:
### Font Awesome was used on some pages on the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes. I have found that certain icons do not display correctly so I had to adapt and make my own for the gogle maps page where I needed a phone icon to appear before the phone number, this was a customised icon that fitted into my site much better than a standard one.
## jQuery:
### jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.
## Git
### Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
## GitHub:
### GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Gitpod.
## Photoshop:
### Photoshop was used to create the logo, resizing images and editing photos for the website.
## Balsamiq:
### Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
# Testing
## The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
### First Time Visitor Goals
## As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

## Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
### The main points are made immediately with the hero image
### The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.
### As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

### The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user, and to allow them to return to the main page at any time, or to navigate to other parts of the site with ease. 

### Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
### The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
### At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.
## Returning Visitor Goals
### As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new places to ride and repair my bike.

## These are clearly shown in the banner message.
### They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.
## As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

## The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
### Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.


# Frequent User Goals
## As a Frequent User, I decided that they would need access to repair sites and places to ride, these will be added and the site will grow as the users add their favourite places that they want to share with other people.

# Further Testing
## The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX, using the functions in Google and the Responsinator.
## Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
# Known Bugs 
## The payment and address information does not work, to get the payment system working and to add a database behind the page is something that will be developed later.

# Deployment
## GitHub Pages
### The project was deployed to GitHub Pages.

# Credits
## Code
### I did not use a full-screen hero image in this version of my project.

### Bootstrap4: i used the Bootstrap Library throughout the project mainly to make site responsive using the Bootstrap Grid System.
### Bootstrap has been invaluable in making a resposive and useable website.
